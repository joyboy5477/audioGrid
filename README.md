# audioGrid

**Problem Statement:**

Design a highly efficient distributed audio transcription system to process large audio files by splitting them into smaller chunks, distributing workloads across cluster nodes using MPI, and optimizing processing within nodes through multithreading. The system will leverage GPU acceleration with Faster Whisper or OpenAI Whisper models, ensuring scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient result aggregation to minimize transcription time while maintaining high accuracy.
